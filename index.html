      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p><strong>I live in a great community</strong> north of Austin, Texas. 
          My experience is in financial systems, application development, relational
          database and IBM OS/400.</p>

       
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was raised in small towns in East Texas (Nacogdoches and Lufkin-
      which explains my accent). I came to the Austin area in 1981 and have been
      in and out of Austin frequently for 30 years. I lived and worked 7 years in
      Rochester, Minnesota. I lived in North Ft. Worth for 18 years
      as wife, mom, homemaker and community volunteer. </p>
      
      <h1>What are my favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy watching a sunrise and a sunset - preferaably over a lake
        or over the ocean. I love to garden and landscape. I enjoy bike riding.
        I love being with my family and friends.</p>

      <h1>What's my dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is in an office with people so I have a reason to wake up
      early, dress in business atire, and go to work - I'm looking forward 
        to the social interraction I'll find there. No remote work at home for me!</p>

      <h1>Where do I live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in a great community North of Austin named Pflugerville. It's
        between a rock (Round Rock) and a weird place (Austin). Anything with the
        phonetic sound of "f" or "ph" will have a local spelling of "pf" - i.e., the
        high schools' statdium is the "Pfield"; farmer is spelled pfarmer. </p>

      <h1>Why do I want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to understand web development so I can use my previous experience with 
        applications development, system security, database, and system performance 
        skills in this current technical world of "everything is about the web".
        
        I also have some ideas of apps I'd like for my phone. I think developing applications
        is a wonderful blend of creativity and technical skills.
